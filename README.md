## Hi! I am Natalia Pricop!

**Full Stack Software Engineer** focused on building secure, database-driven web applications from concept to deployment.

I design full CRUD systems, implement authentication flows, structure relational data models, and connect clean APIs to responsive user interfaces. I care about clear architecture, predictable data flow, and writing code that is easy to reason about and scale.

I enjoy solving real problems, refining edge cases, and turning complex requirements into reliable, working software.

## Professional Focus

**Seeking** a junior software engineering or apprenticeship opportunity where I can contribute to production codebases, collaborate with experienced engineers, and continue strengthening my backend and full stack fundamentals. Open to remote roles or hybrid opportunities in the Chicago area.

**Focused** on continuous growth, secure authentication systems, relational database design, and modern development workflows built around clean architecture and reliable API design.

## About Me
Outside of work, I am a dedicated mom, lifelong learner, and someone who genuinely enjoys building things from scratch whether that means baking for my family or refining a new idea. I value discipline, consistency, and attention to detail, qualities shaped by my legal background and years of working in high-responsibility environments. I recharge through time with family, experimenting in the kitchen, and staying curious about how systems work both in life and in business.
